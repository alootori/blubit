Hi K,

B and I discussed the Point-in-Time Date issue and identified a few key challenges:

Frequent Estimate Changes – Estimates are added and removed multiple times within a single day. For example, refer to the screenshot below for the numbers.
Timing of Aged Claims Referrals – It is more appropriate to check only the Point-in-Time Date when we receive aged claims referrals.
Given these considerations, we decided to use the ‘Estimate Removal Flag’ from the created Redshift table as our direct target variable for positive and negative classes.

We already have 23K data points, which we believe is sufficient for modeling. I have proceeded with EDA and modeling, and we can discuss the details in our catch-up call tomorrow.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
